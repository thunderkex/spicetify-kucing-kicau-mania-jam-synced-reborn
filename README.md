# kucing kicau mania-Jam Synced (Reborn)

![preview](assets/kicaumania.gif)

A reborn and optimized kucing kicau mania-Jam experience, perfectly in sync with your beat. Make a cat appear next to your progress bar, jamming along with your music synchronized to the beat!

Beat data (BPM, beat timestamps, segments, loudness) comes from Spotify's internal audio analysis API endpoint - it sometimes isn't perfect...

**Shift+click the cat** to open the settings popup where you can set custom webm link to your own (Or pick from your local drive), there you can also adjust head drops, position etc. also you can open the debug overlay with live sync stats, beat accuracy, drift, FPS, etc.
